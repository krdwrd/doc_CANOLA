# KrdWrd

The KrdWrd Project ran from 2008 to 2011. The mission statement was
> Provide tools and infrastructure for acquisition, visual annotation, merging and storage of web pages as parts of bigger corpora.
>
> Develop a classification engine that learns to automatically annotate pages, and provide visual tools for inspection of results.

Basically, it was an infrastructure for research into web page cleaning. A good
overview can be found in the paper and an extensive description in the master's thesis (both, see [further down](#cite-work)).
