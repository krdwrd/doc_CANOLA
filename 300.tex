The KrdWrd Project\cite{krdwrd.org} deals with the design of an abstract architecture for 
A)~the unified treatment of Web data for automatic processing, \emph{without} neglecting visual information, on annotation and processing side and 
B)~the appropriate annotation tool to gather data for supervised processing of such data.

The Project comprises an implementation appropriate for pre-processing and cleaning of Web pages, where users are provided with accurate Web page presentations and annotation utilities in a typical browsing environment, while machine learning (ML) algorithms also operate on representations of the visual rendering of Web pages.
The system also preserves the original Web documents and all the additional information contained therein to make different approaches comparable on identical data.

The system is sketched in \cite{StegerStemle2009}.

For training the KrdWrd ML Engine, a substantial amount of hand-annotated data, viz.~Web pages, are needed. 
Following, we present the parts of the system that cover the acquisition of training data, i.e.~the steps before training data can be fed into a ML Engine. 

Then, after an overview of the sequence of steps needed to gather new training data in \ref{sec:systemoverview}, an in-depth description of the processing steps \emph{before} Web pages can be presented to annotators in \ref{sec:preprocessing}, presentation of the actual tool annotators use in \ref{sec:manualannotation}, and the compilation of their submitted results in \ref{sec:goldstandard}, we will be ready to feed the KrdWrd Gold Standard to a ML Engine.
%An exemplification, the KrdWrd ML Engine, is covered in \ref{cha:krdwrdsys2}.
